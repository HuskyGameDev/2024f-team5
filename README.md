### Shorty Shooters

_The little guys are bringing out the **big guns**._

Shorty Shooters is a multiplayer 2-Dimensional side-scrolling shooter game. The objective is to get the most kills by staying in the ring and shooting your opponent while they're vulnerable. Where the game shines is its unique movement mechanics, where you can use the gun's recoil in order to launch yourself further.

### Connecting

Hosting: In order to host a game, press the "Host" button on the main menu. Here, you can choose a port and a password. It is recommended to leave the port number the same, and passwords can be left empty if one is not desired. Once you have begun hosting, you will have control over the game settings and have the ability to kick players (Godot icon by their name). In order for players to be able to join, give them the IP address found in the top left corner of your screen. 

Joining: After pressing the join button on the main menu, you will need to enter the IP address provided by your host. The port number is likely the default, but if it was changed by the host, you will need to set it to the same number here. Then, enter the password (if there is one) and join the server! You can customize your username and appearance here while waiting for the host to start the game. 

### Installation

Download the build for your operating system (Windows or Linux) and simply run the executable file inside.
